# Writing a good outcome statement
An Outcome Statement should describe the measurable improvement(s) to a state’s Medicaid program that will be realized once the project is complete. Additionally, Outcomes should support the priorities of the Medicaid program, be directly enabled by the state’s Information Technology project, and should include a Measurement, which utilizes data as evidence that the Outcome(s) are being met on an ongoing basis. The following elements comprise an Outcome Statement:

* Module - Functional business area of the Medicaid Enterprise that is being enhanced or replaced.
* Program Goal - Identifies the benefit to the Medicaid program upon implementation.
* Outcome Statement - A statement on how the project will measurably benefit the Medicaid program. The Outcome Statement should correlate to the Program Goal.
* Measurement - A product of a formula that correlates to the Outcome Statement, which reflects whether or not the outcome was realized.
