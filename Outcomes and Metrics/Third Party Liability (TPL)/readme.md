# Third Party Liability (TPL)
#### How this system supports the Medicaid Program 

In some cases, Medicaid beneficiaries may have more than one source of coverage for health care services, such as group health plans, self-insured plans, or managed care organizations. Third Party Liability (TPL) systems identify these situations to ensure that the appropriate party pays for services.

## CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements. CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations which pertain to that a specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. 

| **Reference Number** | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Outcome**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Recommended&nbsp;Metrics**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                      | **Regulatory Sources**  | **Minimum Reporting Periodicity** |

## State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

States requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill *state-specific program needs,* beyond minimum legal requirements and the baseline of the *CMS-required outcomes*, should propose *State-Specific Outcomes* which address the proposed enhancements.

When state-specific outcomes statements, keep [these tips](https://cmsgov.github.io/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Certification/writing-outcome-statements) in mind. 

### Examples for Third Party Liability

We are actively gathering and evaluating outcomes statements crafted by states for this business area. 

Please send examples from your state that you'd like to share to <MESCertificationRepo@cms.hhs.gov>. Our team will collect and share the best examples.
