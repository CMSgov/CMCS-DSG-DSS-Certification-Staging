# Health Information Exchange (HIE)
#### How this system supports the Medicaid Program 

A Health Information Exchange allows medical information to be accessed and shared by patients and health care providers, leading to improved coordination of care and better community monitoring.

## CMS-Required Outcomes

None. There are no CMS-Required outcomes for HIE.

As such, for an HIE system to be certified states will need to create or reuse State-Specific Outcomes which target state-specific problems and derive Medicaid program benetis.

## State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

States requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill *state-specific program needs,* beyond minimum legal requirements and the baseline of the *CMS-required outcomes*, should propose *State-Specific Outcomes* which address the proposed enhancements.

When state-specific outcomes statements, keep [these tips](https://cmsgov.github.io/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Certification/writing-outcome-statements) in mind. 
### Examples for Health Information Exchanges

We are actively gathering and evaluating outcomes statements crafted by states for this business area. 

Please send examples from your state that you'd like to share to <MESCertificationRepo@cms.hhs.gov>. Our team will collect and share the best examples.

|Arkansas            |Event Notifications  |Medicaid providers and Medicaid beneficiaries use the HIE to improve care coordination and reduce readmissions while working towards the goal of reducing unnecessary hospitalizations. The HIE will demonstrate its ability to notify PCMHS when their attributed member has an encounter at a hospital. These real-time notifications provide information to PCMHs about a patient’s medical services encounter, demographics, as well as the date and time of the event. The timely collection and distribution of these notifications to the PCMH facilitates the needed follow up care required to improve the overall quality as well as lower the cost of care delivered to patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |To demonstrate that this functionality is operational, the following information will be provided to Medicaid:  -Number of Alerts sent to each PCMH each Month                                                                          |

|Rhode Island        |Event Notifications  |Support the Medicaid program in improving health outcomes by providing clinicians in an emergency department (ED) hospital setting with a flag on a patient record in their EHR when that patient is at risk of an opioid overdose. Connecting beneficiaries to treatment for opioid use disorder after presenting at an ED is a critical opportunity that leads to numerous downstream improvements in care, and might result in a decrease in ED readmission. ED Smart Notifications also support clinical decision-making regarding ED and inpatient care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Ability to provide an opioid flag in ED Smart Notifications (EDSN) (Opioid Flag in place)                                                                                                                                               |
