# Encounter Processing System (EPS) & Managed Care System

#### How this system supports the Medicaid Program

Encounter Processing Systems ingest encounter data (submissions and re-submissions) from MCOs and sends quality transaction feedback back to the plans to ensure appropriate industry standard format. The systems support the tracking of MCO submission requirements and allow the state to enforce consequences for non-compliance. The systems also support payment comparisons and cost of care analysis.

## CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements. CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations which pertain to that specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations.

If a state chooses to use metrics from those listed below, it must calculate them using the specification sheet for those metrics. Download the specification sheets here. <ADD LINK>
