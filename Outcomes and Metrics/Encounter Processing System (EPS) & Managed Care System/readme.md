### CMS-Required Outcomes

Each CMS-Required outcome is based on statutory or regulatory requirements. CMS-Required Outcomes and Metrics are used to demonstrate that a system is compliant with the applicable federal regulations which pertain to that a specific system or module. CMS-Required outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, which must continue to continue to receive enhanced federal funding for operations. 

| **Reference Number** | **Outcome**          | **Recommended Metrics**                                      | **Relevant&nbsp;Regulatory Sources** | **Recommended Reporting Periodicity** |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| [Reference Number]   | [Outcome statement]  | - [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.]<br /><br />- [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.] | [link to regulation(s)]              | [recommended periodicity]             |
| [Reference Number]   | [[Outcome statement] | - [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.]<br /><br />- [Recommended metric one, two, three, etc.] | [link to regulation(s)]              | [recommended periodicity]             |

### State-Specific Outcomes - CMS Approved

State-Specific Outcomes focus on improvements to the Medicaid program not specifically addressed by the CMS-required outcomes. States that are requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill *state-specific program needs,* beyond minimum legal requirements, should propose, and work with the CMS State Officer to finalize, outcomes that address the proposed functionality. Additionally, state-specific outcomes may reflect the unique circumstances or characteristics of the state or territory and its Medicaid program.

While the *CMS-Required* outcomes form the baseline for system/module functionality, it is the *State-Specific Outcomes* that are targeted to solve specific problems and derive key Medicaid program benefits. A system that only meets the *CMS-Required* outcomes is not necessarily a "good" system, which is why *State-Specific Outcomes* should be used provide targeted Medicaid program benefits. 

- **State** - The state which created the outcome and metrics, tied to a specific Medicaid program goal.
- **Medicaid Program Goal** - The high-level objective that orients the outcome statements and metrics to the priority needs for a state's Medicaid program. 
- **Outcome Statement** - Outcomes describe the measurable improvements to a state’s Medicaid program that should result from the delivery of a new module or enhancement to an existing system. Outcomes should support Medicaid program priorities, be directly enabled by the state’s IT project, and be clearly stated in the Advance Planning Document (APD).
- **Metric(s)** - Metrics provide evidence/data that the outcomes are met on an ongoing basis. Metrics should always be tied back to an outcome, and by reviewing metric data, a person should be able to assess if an outcome has been achieved. 
- **Periodicity** - The frequency with which metric data is reported to CMS.
