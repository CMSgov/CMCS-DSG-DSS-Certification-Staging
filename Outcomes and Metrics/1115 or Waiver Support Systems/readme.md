# 1115 or Waiver Support Systems

#### How this system supports the Medicaid Program 

Under a Medicaid waiver, a state can waive certain Medicaid eligibility requirements, covering care for people who might not otherwise be eligible for Medicaid. A waiver support system could be any enhancement to an MES module that helps facilitate changes to the Medicaid program operationalized by an approved waiver.
