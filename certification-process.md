# Incorporating outcome statements into CMS Processes
Outcomes statements and metrics are part of the Advance Planning Document (APD) process and the Streamlined Modular Certification (SMC) process. The program outcomes a state hopes to realize with a proposed Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) project not only serve as justification for the investment, but also serve as a way to measure whether or not the project was a success. Not all projects require certification and not all APDs require outcomes. The following is a general overview of when outcomes and metrics are applicable to the APD process and the SMC process.

## APD process 
An APD serves as the mechanism by which states obtain Federal support for certain systems related expenditures. Regulations establishing the different types of APDs and requirements for each can be found at 45 CFR 95.610. The APDs identified include Planning, Implementation and Operations. As CMS considers program outcomes in its review of states' proposed MES projects, the following will help determine when outcomes and associated metrics are required as a part of the APD. The following is a general guide and states should work with their respective State Officer on the specific details as they relate to a proposed MES project and the need to include outcomes and metrics in an APD.

- Planning - Activities related to systems planning require outcomes and metrics. The outcomes and metrics within the Planning APD will be primarily focused on state-specific outcomes.
- Implementation - Activities related to the design, development and implementation of an automated component of the MES require outcomes and metrics. The outcomes and metrics within the Implementation APD will generally include a combination of both CMS-required and state-specific outcomes. 
- Operations - Activities that improve system performance or extend the life of the system require outcomes and metrics. Routine operating activities do not require outcomes and metrics separate from those that were identified as a condition for continued maintenance and operations support.

## Certification process 
The program outcomes a state hopes to realize with a proposed MES project not only serve as justification for the investment, but they also serve as measures that help determine whether or not the project was a success.  [insert language about outcomes statements + metrics in APDs here]

## State-specific outcomes 
States requesting enhanced FFP for systems that fulfill *state-specific program needs,* beyond minimum legal requirements and the baseline of the *CMS-required outcomes*, should propose *State-Specific Outcomes* which address the proposed enhancements.

*State-Specific Outcomes* should target specific problems and derive Medicaid program benefits. 

# Utilizing this repo 
The CMS Certification Repository is a space for states, CMS, and vendors to learn, share, and contribute information about the MES Certification process and its related artifacts. 

## From this repo states can: 
- Find examples and expectations for developing outcomes and metrics
- Share outcomes and metrics with other states and see examples of what other states have created
- Suggest changes and provide feedback to CMS regarding outcomes requirements and processes (email MESCertificationRepo@cms.hhs.gov)

## From this repo CMS will: 
- Provide publicly available resources to guide states in how to write outcome statements and measure impact
- Share and updated examples of outcome statements and metrics for use in their APDs and certification documents
- Baseline the outcomes and metrics received from states, and compare outcomes and metrics to examples and submissions from other states

## From this repo vendors can: 
- Get direct access to the CMS required outcomes or recommended metrics
- Share suggestions and feedback to CMS regaurding  outcomes requirements and processes (email MESCertificationRepo@cms.hhs.gov)
